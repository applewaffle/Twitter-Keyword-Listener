# TwitterKeywordListener
Listens to a stream of tweets from a specific user and emails the text of the tweet if specific keywords are used.

I recommend keeping the application names generic.  Sometimes it gets funky with versions if they aren't the exact same as how CVENew or whatever 
notification system you want to follow posts them.
