# Twitter Keyword Listener
Listens to a stream of tweets from a specific user and emails the text of the tweet if specific keywords are used.

I recommend keeping the application names generic.  Sometimes it gets funky with versions if they aren't the exact same as how CVENew or whatever 
notification system you want to follow posts them.

You will need to make a Twitter dev account to get the API Keys and Tokens.  

The email section is currently setup to bounce off an open relay.  There are plenty of solutions out there to replace it with something like a gmail account if you prefer.
